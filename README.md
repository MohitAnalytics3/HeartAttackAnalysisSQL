**Heart Attack Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of a dataset related to heart attacks. The dataset includes key features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, old peak, ST slope, and the presence of heart disease.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset to derive meaningful insights related to heart attack risk factors. Using SQL queries, the project aims to answer specific questions, perform statistical analysis, and identify patterns within the dataset.

Key Features
SQL queries for basic statistics on age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate.
Analysis of heart disease cases by gender.
Investigation into the relationship between chest pain types and cholesterol levels.
Calculation of the percentage of cases with exercise-induced angina.
Identification of cases with abnormal ST slope.
Evaluation of the average Oldpeak value for different resting electrocardiographic types.
Technologies Used
